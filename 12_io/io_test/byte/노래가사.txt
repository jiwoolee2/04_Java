You say it's changed
Show must go on, behave
오랜만에 옛 노래해
I'm feelin' like I never left
(That's right) I never left
But you ain't know, O.K then lights, camera
Act like you know
Don't play on me, no, we're
Airbnb, you're homeless
혼비백산-해진-미-장센 (Mise-en-scène)
도레미파시도 (Now, you know it)
두껍아 두껍아 came with the troops
뜯고 맛보고 즐기고 big bang when I shoot
King in the zoo, he gotta do what I do
One of one, not of them (Mirror)
Man in the views aimin' at you
Yeah, I'm aiming at a man, and amen, achoo
Bless you, all cleaned house, fu
Golden days are still alive
외롭다는 말하지 마
내가 있는 곳, 네가 있을 곳
The place that I belong
Home sweet home
Home sick home
Well I said, I would be back
And I'd never let you go
Pick a petal off a flower
Daze you love me nope?
Well I said, I would be back
And I'd never let you go
Pick a petal off a flower
Do you love me or (stop!)
Winner, winner chicken killer, 삼계탕 dinner
하나 둘 set down (one, two, step) 'fantastic'한 팀워크
Not mini, 많이 'More'
Rock, scissors, paper, toast
This is how we do it, just do it, let's do it y'all
Work, work 월화수목금토- 일
They gon' wait til' I'm gone
So I came, I saw, I won
G just D-word is my bond
나 무대로 올라, coup d'e shit
단숨에 호흡곤란, hook catch this
아 '무제' 도 몰라? bull as shit
Whatever, now or never
Golden days are still alive
외롭다는 말하지 마
네가 있을 곳에 내가 있는 걸
The place that I belong
Home sweet home
Home sick home
Well I said, I would be back
And i'd never let you go
Pick a petal off a flower
Daze you love me nope?
Well I said, I would be back
And i'd never let you go
Pick a petal off a flower
Do you love me or (stop!)
We alike dead or alive, your life? Still life
It's so nice, I missed you a lot
You're welcome back home, wherever you are
We alike dead or alive, your life is still with me
Livin' good life, day or nights
The highlight, it's about time to 'rock-on'
Home sweet home
Home sick home
Well, I said, I would be back
And I'd never let you go
Pick a petal off a flower
Daze, you love me, nope?
Well, I said, I would be back
And I'd never let you go
Pick a petal off a flower
Do you love me or (Stop)
